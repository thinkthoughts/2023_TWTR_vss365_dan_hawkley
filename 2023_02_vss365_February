She loves business.

He could tolerate

She likes #connection.

Unless I have more

So I think I'm #extinct

Call me what you will, although I prefer puma to cougar. A wild cat takes what she wants.
I'm no predator, but when this long-legged #serval finds a young buck who wants to play,
I will bite and claw for what I want all night long. Let him die a happy man in my clutches. #vss365

In creationist #mimicry
the first eye was dry
so it blinked.

In creationist #lookology
avoid eye contact
or you're done.

Hunting "stars"
would like to walk
from brick to clock
from clock to brick
around the block at night—
despite the apartheid
#amarok. That's your car.
Here are the tickets & moon
howling for a star; this
morning; coming soon
from this far.

The only flowering plants
growing in marine waters,
seagrasses belong to four
families: P, Z, H & C.

P, Z, H & C
evolved from terrestrial
plants. Off rocky coasts
in coral reefs & seagrass
beds #parrotfishes start
female, then change.

  We know
 the smallest bear
  in the wild world
   will #hibernate
     for decades.

       Better soon,
      it's a hunch,
      a noon will
       be lunch.

Feb 4 was sluggish in a tree
as tall as me the giant their
banshee branched kids dizzied
hatless with pedestrian pillows.
Then waiting I heard, regurgitating
a next Earth word: #kelpie. I miss
Loch Ness & endeavor all the way
from wherever to shape shift
& deprive: Feb 5.

Once my friend Patty said
something wrong —"you're not
edgy." Hm. I can play along w false
but if ever an ocelot was also living
deliberately, like a #sloth in a lull,
I'm not dull—even when full
I'll run around a block & on
Wednesday I said what to do
to a lake w a rock.

+1/365 my 1st date 
(1968 + 16 = 1984)
my bff Jeff's older
sis Janet G finally
went to a #zoophilist
in Boise w me (w us).

Plants have died too. What
they have is a microscope
on the sand on your feet.

To repeat: we have what
they #want to do: throw
a rock into a lake.
