Shoes & news work.
I don't like my legs being
tired and my teeth being
unbrushed.  I like running
to & from appointments
but my legs are missing
50 yrs of sun & lotion. I
like #allure a lot. I figured
I'd just throw that on the end.

It's nice to write Mother's Day
on this week's index card.  On
blue lines you could also fit a
very short skit. Then write
"back" on the back. 

So there: #stopWar has had it
with having it both ways. There,
facing all their glory, we'll have
written Her final #backstory.

their majors from "zero
