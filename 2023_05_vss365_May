It's nice to write Mother's Day
on this week's index card.  On
blue lines you could also fit a
very short skit. Then write
"back" on the back. 

So there: #stopWar has had it
with having it both ways. There,
facing all their glory, we'll have
written Her final #backstory.

Sunlight is the sun, so
a #zillion zeroist zebra
zappers should change
their majors from "zero
life" territorialism (-1) to
zoology: f(x)+1 = you.

For instance: if you're
a #zillion dollar investor
in #bravewrite, & think:
you've likely read
@writer_esther, in pink.

I didn't write Pachinko.
I've read good reviews.
We've read subtitles &
world history, as news:

Before the promised
end of                    land
count "one" #pinball:

Japan's pachinko market
generates more gambling
revenue than that of
Singapore + Macau +
Nevada ≠$0.

I'm a noob at meta
doorknobs. The best
I've done is float
behind Sonic. Idk
which #nub does
what. I just say
"electricity ± works"
all the time. I do
know of a Zelda
master & wish
I'd had a "z" in my
name, like a Zoey
or a Z28. It would
open doors.

Being feminists
solves all mysteries:

 Yes: you've
 observed
 #traffic.

  False: you
  don't exist.
  
When a fender was
bent: what "Everything"
meant was local fear in
general consent:👈🏾

"Nothing" won't do.
"Zero" means stop.
"Mysteries" solved.
"Journalisms" evolved.

#Traffic violations occur
when drivers violate nature's
+1 law: think for yourself: +1.

Violations deny others (-1)
& are quite common between
egomaniacal haters. More
than 90% of Americans
over age 16 drive legally.

"Electricity" identifies 100%
of all connections: 🌙#vss365☀️

A counted boot
is "one" boot.

If you think others
haven't counted boots,
your violence against women
is so unanimously dumb you
think boots should only be
counted in English. by you.
