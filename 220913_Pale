Mountain beers & Sea seers
thought to have beens & sans 
serif twins w snacks—point
pretend haystacks of parallel
pins under hoods & purposes via
neighbor goods & surfaces—surf
above water reading turf
trails & hula hoop dreams
undone—#pale views
still pale in comparison

// Sometimes you make me happy
// Sometimes you make me sad
// Sometimes you make me happy
// But mostly you just make me mad
