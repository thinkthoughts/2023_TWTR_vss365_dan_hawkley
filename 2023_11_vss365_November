I live across a street
from where I left
everything in 2003:
a little encouragement.

More specifically:
a street & parking lot,
I learned, can #exude
a lot of encouragement:
#vss365.

A parking lot is a parking
lot of encouragement. So
I gotta sleep! (like before:
to #endWar).👈🏾

About suffering they were always
Wrong, the old Men; how well they
Misunderstood its clockwise position:
How a #nightmare takes place while
Everybody else is eating & opening
Windows & walking dogs, dully along...
Awaiting a miraculous birth; turning away
From all she's worth: an important failure.

The sun shines as it will: on paired
Lips drinking hot water from expensive
Delicate cups. You have somewhere amazing
To get to. Think about moving on: #vss365.👈🏾☕️

Learning Spanish: no joke;
no #nightmare—like when

I'm sorry. Your one word is I: so

Racism, what’s it like—well, 

I’m the eldest of 9 
Same parents
Only 
All my siblings 
Were born here, in the UK
Unlike me 
But that doesn’t 
Stop them from 
Being targeted 
Any lesser than me 
Coz we’re all shades
Of the same brown 
Though we all bleed 
The same red…

Re: me
Wow 9! At this rate
I'm an oldest of 8.
So we know what 17

nonsense. Nonsense
will make zero sense.
To make sense: one

another of us will
constantly pray

won't #beyond
exist. To double
check w that ball—
resist gravity for all:

Unless you can't plant:
#SaveSoil w oil or acrylic;

"There is nothing"... is now -1=false start;
"There is never"... is always -1=false start;
"There is everything"... is +1=#true start;
"There is always"...= +1=#start "over":👈🫁
