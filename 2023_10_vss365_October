Everyday life is #cosy where
Nature's law is nature's rule:
Elementary school particles
Resist subtraction (-1 = 0); so
Gravity will add another year:
Your future's here: #vss365.👈🏾

Even Einstein was #cosy where
= 2√2 = four :: points = square
= 2^2 = four :: points = 2 pair.👈🏾

teeth sweet hearts & most
recently street smarts. I do
don'ts to surprise ppl like
electric skateboard to work

under a helmet & hat.
I'm missing body parts
for a breakfast song &

There are holes in their
container theories: change one
lightbulb from below & unscrew
a bottle's lid from above; open
cans w can openers. 

These are #vss365 clock tricks
for neck muscles strong enough
to support two brain halves
protected by one climate
feminist's #skull.👈🏾👀🌍

Abbreviate your story. Make it short then
very short then send your love our way—

before earlier today. Was that so difficult, on
a scale from one to #onerous? Maybe it was
very difficult, getting to the point: #vss365.👈🏾
