Journalism: Last night
Heather brought over
her 7 yr old Dylan. We
agreed he'd push me
off an edge into a lit
up blue pool. He went
over to a gated hottub.
I said 314 so he got in
but it was out of order
as written & taped on
a #penultimate door.

We walked over (1/2 tweets) 2:
            to my landlord John's
            Apartment 103 & played
            famous last words. Mine
            were "once upon a time"
            & Dylan's were "famous
            last words." Then they
            left & I finished off a
            popcorn bowl sized
            salad left unfinished
            w a fork by a sink.
