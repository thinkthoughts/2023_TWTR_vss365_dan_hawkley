we wish we were a
ceiling plan cooling off an
#atrocity fan

without ruining
her romance w a future
land—where women are

allowed to stand up
in favor of a barefoot
floor & bathroom door.

we wish we were a
physics paper suggesting
mental health is kind.

we wish were a
haircut book suggesting
whatever you like.

we wish we were a
physicist who believed
scissors will cut hair.

in an electric
