I can't imagine not
mountain biking or
what we like.

If you don't like
skateboarding
what is there to
like? I don't know!

If I were #deaf I'd
have two ears until
hope quit; which
would have to be "the
end" of you too; which
has been & remains
"quite impossible."

When zero future
fails to materialize, be

your #personality.

If you're annoying now,
your property plans have

Fortunately, it's true:

when zero future
fails to materialize,
your delivery skills
will be you.
