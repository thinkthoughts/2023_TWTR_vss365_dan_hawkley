Only poets will surviveâ€”we let
#vss365 solve death after this
between Queens over the East
River from Manhattan Crimson
Mustard & Clover Intersections
between blocks populated with
stadium stops per hour millions
of clocks tick between seconds
of antibodies in the first #Ghost


// looks very square in my TWTR :)
