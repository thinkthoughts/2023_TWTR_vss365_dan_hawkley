If a neighbor's 72
what gravity does
is #communicate
another 24 to 96.

She says life's good
but her husband has
severe dementia so
I don't say it isn't so.

Exit signs suggest we
exit but what gravity
does is communicate
another 24 to 48 years
in fantasies per minute:

Pick a word & stick with it.
"The First Time" means our
moms & dads weren't it:
One two three not it!

Four times four delineates
sixteen blocks away from
"The Next Time" ever
I saw your face.

The Only thing you're not is
"The End Of Time": One
two three not it!

// screenshot: Wikipedia: The official flag of New Mexico consists of a red sun symbol
of the Zia people on a field of gold (yellow). It was officially adopted in 1925 to
highlight the state's Native American and Hispano heritage: It combines a symbol of the
Puebloan people, who have ancient roots in the state, with the colors of the flag of Spain,
which established and ruled Nuevo México for over two and a half centuries.
