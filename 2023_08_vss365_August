tree-drawn peach, pear,
pomegranate pig w orange
sweet potato pie & #plum
pudding. & apples & art...
suck. I want candy! It's a
song; I'm deaf & my eye
balls are all as wrong af:

I stared into the deep #plum -colored eyes of the tiny creature while reaching out to touch its pale skin.
Then it changed back into the giant frog-snake I'd met originally.We communicated on a whole knew level,
telepathy without words.Our DNA just exchanged information.

two groups of five
make twelve groups

integer fields where
violence against will
was every kid's devil.

Let's pretend our senses

standing future plans &
defenses: #scrumptious.
