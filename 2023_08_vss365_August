she didn't like one, or hats.
That's that: food & water

like a hat. So war ended that

The feminine, human face that materialized was for my benefit. I understood that instantly.
The creature was willing to bend to my #hubris and assumptions and become what my limited mind
was most familiar with. It made me feel safe, but I wondered if that was the point.

I stared into the deep #plum -colored eyes of the tiny creature while reaching out to touch its pale skin.
Then it changed back into the giant frog-snake I'd met originally.We communicated on a whole knew level,
telepathy without words.Our DNA just exchanged information.
