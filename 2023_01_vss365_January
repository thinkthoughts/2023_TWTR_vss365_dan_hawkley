Good morning, all of it;
ancient #history; all of it;
including 1 + 1 = 2. We thought
to ask, so thoughts were #true:
where the, am I?
who the, are you?
In the beginning was all of it;  // was all of it:
atoms: the word;                 // the molecules // atoms // ones // guesses, guests
the general theory;              // the general theory;
the general #suggestion;         // the general #suggestion;
like now: good question!;        // the word
                                 // like now: good question!

Studying #history at Time School was hard. Yes you got to meet the actual characters from the books, but that messed up the timelines. Trying to write an essay about an event from the future past is so much harder when the event may not has will happen.

Alexander the heck fell to hell
pretending every other speck
dug his well; so, tell everyone
else in their vernacular:
our man-pants, however tall,
need belts or they'll fall; it's spectacular: "blue pants
just need to be peed, lol—

The only #script to memorize

Was it 2023 or vaguely midnight?

I didn't fall so an ice-breaking
party I had w my snow & garden
shovels was fun.

The bad ice would chip
& the good would #crack
flat into chunks like 2022's 
toffee—mailed from Idaho
before the arctic vortex &
more curse words for snow.
