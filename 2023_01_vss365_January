Every date in the #vss365 crate
zeros in on mature audiences:
language ("no") brief (no)
nudity (no) criminal violence (no)
like smoking (no) guns on (no)
sushi (no) cooking (oh no)
shows for kids (no)!

I told you so & so & so & so
got back together (no)
to rehab (no) a #shadow.

Nice & COOL & just

Facin' each #vss365 beckons
the cast #shadow we'll be sleepin' in
too, as too late — right
before tomorrow's date,
when we're done w light,
by callin' it "tomorrow night."

The last year's word's been "water",
well on its way, dropped on us by
thanking you, but who's dropped what
on who? We'll find out again today
as today remains today ... let's play!

I heard drums.
One was a thud.
That was a rock.
Round coins rolled heads first.
Alex G saved the animals

Both had a #tradition.
I stole this one: #vss365 #dust.

Thanks y'all.

Studying #history at Time School was hard. Yes you got to meet the actual characters from the books, but that messed up the timelines. Trying to write an essay about an event from the future past is so much harder when the event may not has will happen.
