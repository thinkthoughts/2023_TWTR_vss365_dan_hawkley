Oops, the word is #work.
Work works in loops.

Every night slept through
till morning. I haven't looked
out a front door. I left
a snow shovel so
I won't leave
icy footprints
coming back.

Way back when,
existence existed.
His empress resisted.
His empires expired.

She knew it was time for the careful #work of bundling dried herbs. 

Squinting against dusk’s last shard of sun, she lit the faded mass. Its smoke drew animals with sharp teeth to follow her. Once the trees hid them, she spoke.

“It’s time for teeth to take the bad.”

I adhered motion

ceiling. When I
slide its mirrors,
there u are: light on
clothes to choose
between; which I will
wear & which I will
drop off @ Good Will.

I hand-washed
a few baseball hats.

I read your #vss365.

Today. For kicks.
Picked R Wilbur

It's a party. For looks.
A #celebration of sorts
Like a film festival's best extra
Very short shorts: "The Wildness
To Rejoice" like a beast on
All fours, #will square doors
& wear shoes to #stopWars.

She talks flavor

I'm more a music lover

I'd rather crash
my mtn bike

then fall on a rock,
than talk.
There is this
poetry thing "to be alive"
but still, I'd rather make
a beat per minute
than "never" eat
what's in it.

No grocery store closes
when hipsters w noses
park by dumpsters to
discover waste & recover
food. Being #vulnerable
to a mood, they sped off
in haste, spinach-faced
to spend nights beyond
red lights w peanuts for
guts collecting disposable
hours: by watering wall
flowers.

Word! Cougars are fire.
So an English degree
from BYU is a reason
to Provo, die & perspire!
Or would it be Notre Dame?
After the dance we're all
the same; #trance: word
salads dressing plants.

coincidentally a
 resident advisor
 just threw a true
ghost dance
blue party
combating violence
 against fear
 w "guaracha"
  & "justice"
   (for all)
   just earlier
   this brand
    (this small)
     new year w
    wine, beer &
   one drinking water:

   Sounds like the moon,
or the earth is flat
footed where
a musical chair
might've Sat,
tomorrow
after the dance,
had his pants
not been on fire—
trust us, it was dire
straights playin'
money for nothin' 🤣

However many stairs,
 leading shoe prints
    end in pairs; some
were ours while
 all were theirs. So,
when writing
    like a dancer,
       a question is
   "not" an answer;
  or, a billion feet
    wore half the odds
  that they would be
    our dancing gods.

//technically🤓: Godel turned out to be an unadulterated Platonist, and apparently believed that
an eternal "not" was laid up in heaven, where logicians might hope to meet it hereafter.

On this Godel commented:

Concerning my "unadulterated" Platonish, it is no more unadulturated
than Russell's own in 1921 when in the Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy ...
he said, "Logic is concerned witht the real world as truly as zoology, though with
its more abstract and general features." At that time evidently Russell had met the "not"
